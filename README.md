# Diabetes Prediction Project (Python Analysis)

## Overview
This README explains the detailed steps of data analysis and modeling performed in Python to predict diabetes using patient health data.

## What I Did and Why

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- **Checked missing values:** To ensure no gaps that affect modeling.
- **Filled missing numeric data with mean:** To keep data consistent without losing rows.
- **Encoded categorical data (Gender, CLASS):** Machine learning models require numbers, so converted categories (e.g., Male/Female, Diabetes/No Diabetes) into 0 and 1.
- **Removed duplicates:** To avoid bias from repeated entries.
- **Scaled features:** Standardized data to make all features comparable for better model performance.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive statistics:** To understand basic info like mean, median, min, max of features.
- **Correlation heatmap:** To see how features relate to each other (e.g., Age and BMI correlation).
- **Distribution plots (Gender, CLASS):** To see how many patients are male/female and diabetic/non-diabetic.
- **Scatter plots (Age vs BMI):** Visualized how diabetes cases spread with age and BMI.

### 3. Machine Learning Models
- **Split data into training and testing sets:** To train models and evaluate on unseen data.
- **Logistic Regression:** Simple model to classify diabetes presence.
- **Random Forest Classifier:** More powerful model that uses multiple decision trees.
- **Made predictions on test data.**

### 4. Model Evaluation
- **Accuracy score:** How many predictions were correct overall.
- **Classification report:** Precision, recall, and F1-score to measure model quality in more detail.
- **Confusion matrix visualization:** Table that shows true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives to understand model errors.

### 5. Feature Importance Analysis
- **Extracted feature importance from Random Forest:** To know which health indicators (e.g., BMI, Age, Cholesterol) most affect diabetes prediction.
- **Bar plot of feature importance:** Easy visual understanding of key features.

### 6. KMeans Clustering
- **Performed clustering to group patients:** Without using labels, to find natural groupings in the data.
- **Visualized clusters with Age vs BMI scatter plot:** To see patterns in how patients group by these features.

## What These Steps Show

- **Data cleaning ensures reliability** so models learn from good quality data.
- **EDA reveals underlying patterns** and relationships in the data.
- **Models predict diabetes status** and their evaluation tells how well they perform.
- **Feature importance points to key health metrics** doctors should watch.
- **Clustering helps discover patient subgroups** that might need different care.

## Summary

This Python analysis builds a strong foundation for predicting diabetes using health data by cleaning, exploring, modeling, evaluating, and interpreting results with clear visualizations.
